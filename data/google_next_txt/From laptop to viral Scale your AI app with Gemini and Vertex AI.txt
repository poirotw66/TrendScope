 STEPHANIE WONG- Hi, I'm Stephanie, an AI ML engineer at Google Cloud. And we had a session on how to take an app from laptop to viral. The app we showed today was AutoCal. AutoCal is focused on being able to get a screenshot and transforming that screenshot into a Google Calendar event. For example, here we have a reformer Pilates class that AutoCal has transformed into an event in Google Calendar. AutoCal was great as it was. However, in order to be able to handle viral success, there were three key things that AutoCal could not do quite yet. The first was handle millions of users. It also needed to be run somewhere. And it also needed to be run securely. In order to do that, we used an event-driven architecture, app hosting, and authentication. This architecture shows the end of AutoCal 2.0, where we're able to add in authentication, Firebase app hosting, and also an event-driven function that process images submitted by users. A key part of AutoCal being successful and handling viral success is being able to iterate quickly. So we used a host of Google Cloud tools to build a CI CD pipeline. With that, we had AutoCal 2.0 that was able to take a conversation and transform it into a calendar invite. From this, we were able to learn that actually, yes, AutoCal 2.0 did take a lot more time to code. We did have a lot more frictions and frustrations. However, from just me being able to use AutoCal, now millions of people can use AutoCal. So we were able to have a higher impact and a higher value of that. Thank you.rent A
