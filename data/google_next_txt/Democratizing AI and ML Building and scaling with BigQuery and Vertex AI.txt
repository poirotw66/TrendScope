 Hello everyone, I am Nivedita Kumari, Data Analytics Customer Engineer at Google Cloud. Today we will explore how BigQuery and Vertex AI are democratizing AI ML, making it easier to build and scale intelligent applications. Businesses today struggle in meeting the demands of the AI era due to fragmented tools and face a critical need to upskill employees in data and AI. This emphasizes the need and the importance of unified tools and investing in employee skills to succeed with AI. Other perceived barriers to AI ML adoption are cost, complexity, lack of expertise, and accessibility. These are the problems we are solving. BigQuery addresses these directly. Google Cloud provides a unified platform with BigQuery at the center, simplifying data analytics and machine learning. This unification is key in providing a unified data experience, handling diverse data types and data formats, unified compute engine supporting popular languages, unified collaboration across teams and clouds, and unified governance for control and insights. When you look at a traditional ML, it is a multi-step process involving data warehouses, exporting data for training to separate tools, and figuring out deployment. This creates problems with data governance, requires significant infrastructure management, and demands teams to learn different tools and languages. That's where BigQuery machine learning, also known as BQML, comes to picture. It simplifies these by bringing ML directly to your data. No more exporting the data, you can train and deploy models within BigQuery. This eliminates data governance headaches, infrastructure management, and the need for separate hosting, providing a truly unified solution. BigQuery ML empowers more users by using SQL. The language data analysts already know. BigQuery ML provides a comprehensive ML platform, covering feature engineering, training, inference, and model management for evaluation, registration, and monitoring your models. Plus, it offers the flexibility by letting you use external TensorFlow models and export to Vertex AI. Apart from these, BigQuery ML also opens the door to the exciting world of generative AI. It provides that SQL interface to Vertex AI, allowing you to leverage the data storage, Gemini models, and open source models. Gemini models are multimodal, meaning you can work with a variety of data types. And BigQuery fully supports structured text, image, and video data, enabling a wide range of applications. Here are some applications on how integration of BigQuery and generative AI can transform your data operations. Imagine being able to extract key entities, enrich your data with new insights, understand customer sentiment, generate personalized content, and even analyze video. The potential is truly vast. To summarize, BigQuery ML empowers more users to leverage machine learning by using familiar SQL, eliminating the need for specialized expertise. It also simplifies the process of managing the underlying infrastructure and ensures both the data and the model are secure with Google Cloud's robust access controls. Ultimately, providing the scalability to handle the largest AI ML workloads. BigQuery ML and Vertex AI empowers your entire data team to build and scale AI, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. This unlocks a future where AI is accessible to everyone, driving innovation across your organization. Thank you all for joining us on this exploration of the power of AI and ML with BigQuery. Happy learning! Happy learning! Happy learning! Thank you!
