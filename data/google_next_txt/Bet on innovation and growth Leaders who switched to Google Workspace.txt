 you're still here congratulations and a big thank you for making an effort to come to this next session to talk about bet on innovation and growth working with leaders talking about what happened when they switched to google workspace what were those outcomes so we're going to talk about that today we're really going to kind of focus on a kind of key concept in my little spiel before bringing customers up and it's this idea that we really should be in this this state of constantly changing the patterns of work that we're in right i get the pleasure to work with tons of customers on a yearly basis and you know admittedly i really like to work with people that aren't our customer yet i like to talk to them about why workspace is really special why the human element is different with our technology and frankly one of the biggest things that i always hear from executives and i try to preempt this as much as possible is how can we how can we do this how can we move how can we change we've been working the same way for 10 20 years and the one thing that always comes to mind with that for me is do you view that as a competitive advantage with all of the tools that exist today if you're working the same way that you did 10 or 20 years ago are you getting the most out of what's available to you are you working with with more people than you should be or less people than you should be and so that idea has kind of inspired this other this other quote that i reference often specifically because of generative ai and gemini coming into the platform is this concept that routines impede innovation right same thing if you're working the same way routines can be very beneficial in daily life but in the context of work and technology routines should be broken constantly based on the new innovations that are available to you like i work fundamentally differently than i did six months ago because of the advancements within our platform and it's awesome i'm going to work differently in six months six months from now and i can't wait right i see the roadmap a lot and it's incredible what's coming down the road flows was announced this week right there's so many great great things that come with this platform and so we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about why we feel it's really important we're going to bring up a great panel of customers and a little bit i'm tony majuski i'm a part of our global growth and strategy team for google workspace i'm based in new york i've been with this organization for four years i've been in this ecosystem for about a decade with a partner i love talking about this this technology i love talking about how it impacts people how it impacts organizations and again i talk to a lot of people that aren't our customer yet and i was talking to uh i think it was a european customer a couple weeks ago and this idea popped into my head about the concept of change and why we can't change and it just it was an epiphany that i had was you know there's a lot of people that don't want you to change right it's cyber security threat actors they want you to stand as still as possible right they don't want you to move quickly when the concept of risk and vulnerabilities right they want your patches to not go out on tuesday like they'd prefer thursday right so they prefer you to stand still there's people that are complacent they don't necessarily want change they like their routines they got their thing they're comfortable right and then your competition definitely wants you to stand still absolutely right your competition does not want you to change at all they don't want you to be in constant state of innovation they look at that as their advantage and so those are the things that we want to address that's the area where we see people lean in and look at workspace as a transformation project right you want to create a culture of openness i admittedly pre-google didn't like to share anything until i was 80 done with something that's when i was comfortable and confident to to put something in front of a team or colleagues or a leader's eyes and when i came to google there you see that blend of technology and culture right first draft culture the second that you hit docs.new so we have the url for that docs.new fires up a new google doc it's really easy it's great you share it with the people that you're working with right away blank page and things get done faster you achieve impact faster the quality the openness the the collaboration is all improved when you have that first draft culture when you have that that culture of openness when you're taking a little bit of risk on a new venture right you see higher rates of innovation and that's an output that our customers see and so if you're not a customer today and you know you're at google next i think there's a handful of technology concepts that have been put in front of you the last few days now it's time to prioritize what are we going to work on what's going to be what's going to be that project that gets most of our funding and our resources because they're not unlimited i think we all know that but if someone puts together a brief hey we've got this project we're going to see an improvement in collaboration we're going to see a payback on our investment in less than six months we're going to save money we're going to enhance security we're going to retire redundant systems we're going to improve speed of finding information search is going to be improved oh and the roi is going to be over 300 i think most business leaders like i think we got to take a look at this oh and by the way it touches everyone in the company it's going to improve our employee experience broadly that is meaningful and that's what happens when organizations switch to workspace it is a very unique technology project because it touches everyone in the organization it improves cyber security it's streamlined costs right and then we also look at what we're doing from a generative ai perspective we've been doing assistive ai in the platform for 10 years it's built an incredible foundation when it comes to having collaborative ai as well and so those are those impacts and you know it is called workspace it was called g suite it was called google apps for work or business and then i think google apps for that right but it's not that previous version today it's so much more it includes things like app sheet it includes things like notebook lm plus it includes things like gemini app and it's connected it's cloud native by default which is a superpower for organizations from a user's perspective but absolutely from an admin perspective as well a governance perspective a security perspective you have line of sight to everything at all times you've got that generative ai experience available in the browser available on mobile it's very meaningful when it when it comes to creating that really elevated employee experience and then again we made an awesome announcement in january we said generative ai is essential it's going to be included in our core skews at no additional cost it's going to include gemini app it's going to include google vids which is a generative ai based video editor that pretty much operates like slides but it's producing rich video with ai voice overs and ai generated scripts massively valuable for things like change management learning and development engaging with your customers and partners and then notebook lm plus which if no one's using that today if you're not using it today dive into notebook lm plus it is one of the coolest tools i think google has developed in the last few years so you have that embedded persistent generative ai experience across the entire platform and it's for everyone it's for your knowledge workers it's for your frontline workers you have access to things like gems really fantastic technology and so right now when things are moving faster and faster amy webb is a ceo for the think tank in new york she calls this this pace of innovation it's rapidly accelerating so having a technology partner where essentially the entire responsibility is on them to invest in the innovation that's really really beneficial to the customer right we're pushing out those hundreds of features a year without any patching it's going to be browser defile browser browser browser neighbor it's going to be cloud native by default so that partnership is going to help you have a more secure environment it's going to protect your data it's going to allow you to be more innovative it's going to support growth and scale and it's going to improve that culture right there's definitely a culture and technology element to this and i think we're going to cover that when i welcome our panelists up to the stage right now so we'll go ahead and bring our customers up and give them a round of applause all right and so we'll go ahead and have everyone introduce themselves ashley why don't you start us off sure nice to meet you guys i'm ashley hatter senior director of enterprise technology at trellix i lead our global workplace technology platform so any platforms that enables our employees to do their day-to-day job might be a little biased but google workspace is my favorite one to manage um i took trellix to google about a little over a year ago and we did that migration in just three months um but i'm fortunate that this is my third company that i've taken google um in my spare time love hanging out with my family and training for triathlons with my husband so excited to talk to you guys some more awesome michael all right i'm the uh director of it infrastructure for wind supply um my role covers platform development network operations data center operations and uh client support division um we went to google workspace about two years or actually about a year and a half ago and uh it took us i don't know roughly six months to get there and uh i don't know that's that's about it melissa hi my name is melissa i lead the hr team at grupo bochicario a brazilian-based company in the cosmetic industry uh we moved to google uh four three to four years ago and it was a very challenging uh process that i'm very thrilled to talk about a little bit further awesome fantastic let's get into it and we'll start with a pretty simple one ashley why did you switch to google workspace yeah so we're always thinking about you know our customers our partners and our employees and when you have the right tools and technology you can do more together and google workspace really allows you to do that there's real-time collaboration you have the mobile apps you're able to now innovate with ai um so google was just really the obvious answer uh for us fantastic michael how about you so we were a little different than most we were on an aging lotus note system um we had an on-premise system we were seeing the need for growth we were seeing the need to provide more value to our end users so that's kind of how we landed on google fantastic melissa how about you cool uh we had any organizational transition it has to be anchored in a very clear problem we want to solve because it's a it's a very difficult um and challenging process to to have and for us in the past five years we had three main challenges first of all we had the pandemic where we went from a face-to-face um work where people commuted to work and they were sitting side by side with their colleagues and they could build materials together uh to a totally remote work and people had to join meetings so they could collaborate uh second of all we had this major organizational structure transformation where we went from a business sent a business unit centric model to a matrix model more um from a customer journey perspective uh and third we had this move where we started building in-house our technology and stopped outsourcing so the decision making process and the way we used to work changed a lot and we had to start changing the tools we used to do our jobs so people could collaborate more and could be more productive in order to thrive in this environment so that's when we started with google fantastic all right so ashley back to you how is it different to work with google workspace yeah i mean i know i said why we switched was real-time collaboration but like honestly real-time collaboration like you're now able to communicate with your employees be in the same google doc working on stuff at the same time building presentations for your board at the same time without needing to oh i'm editing and i'm locked out of this document so let me know when you're done editing that document or sharing version histories across via email so just being able to have that collaboration at your fingertips um also the mobile applications are so great like we get so much feedback about our uh being able to be able to work on the go so google workspace really allows you to be you know connected via any device anywhere any yeah as long as you have an internet connection i mean you can even turn them offline and work on the go so um that's just really awesome uh for our employees and then everyone now thinks so differently about the way that they do their day-to-day job um google's coming out with enhancements every single day um the first company that i took google google chat used to be google hangouts and only allowed 25 people on a meeting now it's google meet and allows 500 people on a meeting so um seeing those enhancements and just like little things that are coming out all the time help our employees think about like how can i do this differently and what workflows can i do better now that i have all these tools at my fingertips that's great yeah i talked to a customer yesterday who has had a persistent google meet for a virtual hangout for over 1800 days oh my goodness there's some different ways to use that's for sure michael how about you so um with since we've gone to google workspace we've seen a lot of the same things with better collaboration inter and intra team being able to collaborate on a collaborate on a google sheet that's life-changing i don't know if most of you out there you'll see an excel sheet that you're sharing back and forth five times in real time you can watch people interact the google spaces has been revolutionary for communication and that that's a huge thing i'd have to give you a little background into our company but every location is independently owned so within those locations them being able to collaborate internally and then with the other companies really facilitates communication that's great and melissa um i think there are two perspectives we uh i think we have collaboration and we have productivity when we talk about collaboration we have a totally synced workspace where people can collaborate and uh we can build materials together uh in distance so um working from home you can just sync with your co-worker and build some materials and slides and sheets and you can give feedback uh in real time just by commenting on your docs so this is really good opposed to the other way we used to work where you have to have version one and version two and then version 64 of your materials and have that back and forth uh by email and you had all this scattered um documents and you didn't really know which one was the last updated you have so it was um a bit more difficult to collaborate so i think this is one thing and the other thing is productivity so collaboration as i said is one of one of them but we have process improvements too so um as we make people um work in a different way by changing their tools uh they also start thinking in another way they can do the same job so just for an example we saved around 11 000 hours just from switching to web sheet some of our processes so yeah process improvement totally and third we have gemini so uh january we had it released and now we are we are implemented it in our company and it's embedded in workspace and we can have uh from summarizing documents to creating presentations and that's that helps us to be much more effective yeah i think one of the biggest pieces of feedback for gemini is keeping people present in the job rather than a lot of the ancillary things that they do the gray parts of their their day-to-day like taking notes in a meeting a very simple one for sure so ashley back to you you've done this three times i expect a very thorough answer here what was your process for the technical change yeah i think to start um when you're moving to google workspace like the hard part is not the technical piece of it you're moving data from here you're moving to data from there the hard part is the people these these employees have been abusing the tools that they've used for probably since they started work so they're going to be really resistant to the change they're nervous about the change but it's such a great opportunity like the whole company is going through this together so there's an opportunity to you know bring the culture together change the culture create a sense of community um and so also lean into fun google is so fun i say this all the time when i talk about google workspace migrations like there's so much opportunity to have fun here but really we broke it down into like four and a half phases um the first phase was our enterprise technology and operations team so we joke all the time that you know we like to drink our own champagne um that way when we get to whatever we're doing we're giving our employees the best bottle of champagne there is out there um so we decided to make the switch first that really helped us to fine tune any technical pieces get feedback from our core team on you know how are the training materials the communications that are going out and really focusing and fine tuning that robust change management strategy the half phase i was talking about is we decided to give everyone google drive access um from the beginning so that really isn't a hindrance to your migration you know give the employees the tools that they're probably going to be using let them feel what that's going to be like show them the enhanced collaboration that they're going to get and that really helps starts to change some of the mindset of people who are going through that change um the second uh phase that we did was our executive leadership team so that was really important to us to make sure that we had senior buy-in uh top down um and this also helped with they're getting a lot of that hesitation and nervousness from their team so if their team is saying oh no we can't go i'm going to do x y and z and they're like i'm already on it it's great i'm loving it you're going to be fine that is such a huge thing and also helps ease the executive leadership team's nerves too because they don't need to be nervous if their team is nervous because they're already on there um the third and probably the most important phase is what we called the google guides so this was volunteers across our organization globally um they were able to opt in to go early and we really helped them um tell them that they were going to be like leaders of their organization it wasn't just like something that they can volunteer to get on they wanted to lead the organization help their teams through it and then that way you can really really lean on them on go live to help with any questions that your organization may be getting because there's going to be lots of questions on go live so if you have you know 10 of your organization who are really strong champions and helping them through that change that really helps and then the last stage is you know go live and so that's everyone um and we really leaned into the fun here we had office launch events we made it a whole day like it was we're going google today and it is a launch day go into your office we have little hubs for people to go into and ask questions and get hands-on help whether that's downloading um any of the apps setting up their gmails um there was food there was swags we had little fun like games to play in order to give out um some events there um and swag so really leaning into the fun uh for launch day stellar that's great michael how about you so walking through the technical change our our journey kind of started with the leadership team we got together our senior leadership group and um started gathering the details on what the migration was going to look like and looking at the competitors and seeing which direction we wanted to go once we landed on google i'll give a plug to the company that helped us migrate we picked a partner and we went with promivo and i'm hopefully i'm allowed to say that but uh they did an excellent job helping us through the technical change they handled we did a change management with them plus we had an internal project manager so with between those two we came up with a plan to migrate our company in seven phases to not overwhelm our support division and then every time we went live one of the cool things was what we saw was as locations went live you gained almost a community support where people would get on they would learn they'd say here's the cool feature your it your it team can't possibly take on the full support of learning all the ins and outs of the tools so it's it's your user base finding what's meaningful what makes their day easier and then you start to to move there at that part um and then uh once you identify those champions then you start seeing growth within the tools ours initially started as it was an email project we were going from lotus notes to google workspace for mail and then we started seeing a drive adoption and spaces adoption and once we saw more tools being adopted we really started seeing the value we were getting the support calls started to go down and then we we got to normal amazing yeah we have such an excellent community of partners to help that have done this with companies of all shapes and sizes you know six figure employees global so a ton of help in that in that area as well alissa how about you cool um well uh our technical uh transformation were we had two main fronts of work we had um work with two partners one of them for the file email most of data migration and the second one for the process migration which was the biggest challenge for us um so for that process migration we tried to break it down into main uh processes we had um our processes being mapped uh together with our users so we just sent out some google forms to know which processes were uh more complex and that needed more support and from the feedback on that forms we could uh map what we needed to do and then we could just migrate from a one-to-one tool so the old tool to the new one and then we had this partner helping us with this migration uh the second one we migrated to that to data products so we had data coaches in our company helping people to build their analysis in data products actually and third one which was the most complex one we went from um the other the old tools uh to a digital product because we had more complex process that needed to be put it in our tech team backlog to become an actual digital product and that way we were able to migrate 1800 processes in our company and the second one we had the user support so people could migrate their processes um inside their their own areas with the support of our partner um so if they had any doubts if some formula broke down they had someone to help them with amazing and so you know we talked technical we touched i think a little bit of culture but ashley how did you manage the the culture change in the shift to that cloud native productivity platform yeah i'm i mean it's really all about you know bringing your company together as a community so whether that was things that we were doing around like uh gamification so you know you know when we were migrating data like people who could get rid of the most amount of files that they no longer needed would get something like google swag related or um on launch day if we sent out you know we had a google site that was created that was basically uh anything that you could need for the migration we hid little google hats throughout the site you would click on it and you would enter into a raffle to get some kind of google swag and then also post uh go live we did a lot of things around you know if employees were finding new ways to do things come and tell us and we would highlight them in whether that was like uh after we went google we you know changed our theme to living google um and so we would put them in a living google uh newsletter to help highlight you know here are the new innovative fun things that people are doing and that you can do as well um and that also helped you know bring together around some kind of like center of excellences that we needed especially around app sheet um so a lot of people were leaning into app sheet to leverage some automation of their business workflows that they needed off of the other tools um and so that was really another fun way to bring people together there's now a center of excellence people are helping each other create new things people post questions in there all the time like i have this idea but i'm not sure where to start and there's a ton of people who are out there helping each other um and then i think the other thing too is like google's cloud first built in the cloud it's cloud native um so the ability to integrate with any of our existing tools that we may use today whether that's pager duty or wiz and leveraging it in you know google chat to do alerts or automation um and just helping drive that innovation across our employees was something that we kept trying to promote and make fun fantastic michael so this goes back to being partner assisted so with culture change we we had a great partner that helped us with a communication plan and it starts out with google's coming there's a change coming and you know it was it was a slow roll out of you have to let people know what's coming give them a communication when it's coming what the change is going to look like that way by the time day one comes they know they have some expectations of what what is supposed to be there and how it was supposed to get there and assuming everything went well which it did um uh when when you get there it just works fantastic communication is highly critical no one wants to be surprised on launch day melissa how about you well uh cultural change is very challenging you're moving people out of their comfort zones so it takes a little bit of effort to doing that i'll take myself as an example when all of this migration to google happened i was on the other side of the table i wasn't leading the whole project and i was the employee who had to change the tools that they were used to work with and it was a little bit scary at first so there was a natural resistance because people were just uh worried if they could uh do the work as they used to and the the answer is you were not going to do your work the work the way you used to do it you were going to do it in a much productive way but changing is hard so we had to go with this um senior management tier engagement at first so they could help us um send the message to the teams that uh there were benefits coming out of it too and they were supporting this move that we were making so that helped us a lot and to engage this senior management tier we had to have um consistent alignment uh risk mapping it was very important to um make them comfortable about the transition that the operation would not stop because of this transition happening the processes would still uh be running and communication uh it was very important people needed to know that that google was coming and that we had a roadmap and that they could have a support from our partners too if they had any doubts so we tried to make them comfortable in some levels so they could transition um in a slow way and then get get used to it so at first it wasn't easy people didn't get very happy we had uh minus 16 nps in our first measurement but then we improved by 70 points our our nps in just a couple of years so people really started using it and they started seeing the benefits around it so it was really nice fantastic and so google is constantly pushing out new capabilities new features you know notebook lm plus is there google vids is there now uh so how do you kind of keep up with google and that innovation and enable your workforce on the new tools and new capabilities yeah i mean i think it's the process is always going to evolve so like when we launched google we were very heavy user guides very we had a google site that was housed everything um very heavy user guides very very heavy trainings we had office hour sessions that were quite literally like three hours of our you know going google team where people could pop in ask questions get the support that they needed um and it was a little bit of like hand holding in the beginning um but as you know the longer you're on google workspace you evolve your employees evolve so there was always we were sending out forms of you know where are you still stuck what can we help you with and taking a look at those results and seeing okay do we need ethro ad hoc you know 15 minute meetings on the calendar for people to join if they want do we need to create some little clips on how to do x y and z and post them on you know now our living google page and just always continually trying to get the voice of our employees and what they need um we also did a uh like living google monthly newsletter after we were go live to try and like you know if there was little ad hoc things that we did we would post that in there always showcasing like the fun things that other employees are doing and then any new features that are coming um we also have a chat space uh that's open to all of our employees that's google announcements so i'm always keeping an eye on the fun things that google's coming out with um and then we're posting it there um when there's big things like gemini um that was a really fun one and we knew that we were going to need a little more hands-on again so we took a month to state you know we said what is our change management plan going to be for this um what are the types of trainings we need held those trainings created the materials that we needed for that so it's always dependent on is it a big announcement is a small announcement and then listening to your employees on what they need because sometimes they need a lot and sometimes they need a little so just making sure you're you're listening there um and then another thing that we'll do a lot too is we'll host little internal hackathons so we'll do like a day where come with a problem that you're trying to solve and like the goal is you in that day where we've solved that salute you've solved that problem with something that's a solution within google workspace um a lot of the times are virtual because i think we live in a mostly virtual world now but where we can do them in person it's a really great opportunity to bring people together great michael so for us we have a very diverse workforce everybody's in a different position in their technical journey so we had we have an lms that we set up and we put google material and actually google does a great job of hosting that and keeping that material up to date um we set up a google drive where we publish some content um let's see we we created some loom videos that were just really quick like you want to accomplish this this is what you're going to do so it gets people right to what they need to do um let's see one of the unique ways that we overcame some of the challenges were during the migration we actually put people on planes so we put it people and sent them around the country to some of our most impactful locations and had them sit with users and show them the day one operations and how they were going to get off the ground and that's one thing that i would recommend if you have the opportunity to connect with your connect with your customer wherever wherever they are and sit with them and help them get up and online fantastic melissa how about you um for us it's about training support and consistent communication so we had a live training for our employees over 350 hours of of live training we had also our async training trails so we had it on google sites and people could access it whenever they needed to we also had our ambassadors program which were our enthusiasts so early adopters that really liked google and helped us communicate better inside the teams and show uh the benefits of google so it it worked and we had over 500 employees in our google ambassadors teams uh and we had the support center so we had this partner helping us with all our teams um doubts and mostly uh uh communicate constant communication i think that was the the main key uh to um have them uh working around uh google definitely and some of the things that we're trying to do from a google perspective is we've got a new blog called workspace drops monthly collection of what we're doing from a feature release perspective and i've also seen some partners do some really clever things using notebook lm and using our support site to essentially create a notebook lm version of our support site so people can go in and directly ask a question related to well this is how i did it in the previous life how do i do it now that i'm living google i thought that was super clever and ways that you can use these cutting-edge new tools same with google vids using google vids as a way to have that video to to host training and and change management uh for anyone not just professional video editors so we've seen some really great ways to use our tools and our content to help with that um so actually we like to mention partnership a lot with google and especially specifically with workspace we had a great opm team uh that's working with customers so what does it mean for your organization when you think partnership with workspace yeah i mean like think about it how many companies do you guys work with where you send feedback for feature requests and you actually see that feature implemented throughout its product probably slim to none so it's great to partner with google workspace because we have a steady stream of like we are always submitting feature requests um to help enhance the products and someone is sitting there with us every month reviewing those enhancements that like we're requesting for and telling us where it is in the pipeline has it even been considered if it's not been considered it hasn't been considered because we're thinking about doing this differently and it's going to come out this way or it's slated on the road map thank you for your suggestion and things like um i can give you a few examples a lot of our employees um when you would start calling someone on uh google chat it would start with a video first and so a lot of our employees especially in sales like to just call each other really quickly didn't want video on um so a new feature had come out you know recently that was audio first huddles which was super awesome and it was a way for us to say you asked google answered um other things around we used poly a lot and now we you know we didn't really want a third um party application integrated into our tools and the google chat team came out with you know an out of the box poll integration um so there's just always things where google is taking the voice of the customer seriously and it just it's so refreshing to be able to have your voice have a seat at the table especially at a company that's so large and does so much and you know you're just one person's voice but you see those products so um i mean i love that i think that's you know a great thing about going google is that your your voice is going to be heard great michael how about you so i i'll emphasize the word partnership so since we since we moved to google what we've noticed is that there's a lot of engagement from google google is really there for us um if if we have questions we can we can get people on the phone and actually have real conversations um it's i mean the best way i would describe it as a big business that still feels like a small business which reflects a lot in how our organization runs so there's a really good synergy between the two and it's really empowering that's great and melissa for us it means two things the first of them it's enabling the best way of working in our company to achieve our goals as a company and the second one is being ahead on innovation so we know we have cutting edge technology to solve our pro to help us solve our business problems amazing and so you've done it you've done it multiple times uh if you had to do it again ashley what's one thing that you would have done differently yeah i would say take really take a look at your you know what your data migration plan is um and i would frame up the migration as you have the least amount of people with or you have the people with the least amount of data going first and the people who have a lot of data store them towards the end of your migration that way those people who have a lot of data um they're not holding up your you know data migration pipeline um so by the time you get to go live maybe you have like one percent of employees who they have like three years worth of data and not like 10 years worth of data but that's so much easier to manage with a small subset of people than saying hey you you know we have a lot of people who are not going to go live with their data because we're held up from people who have a large-minded data um the other thing i would maybe say too is if you are doing it in a phased approach maybe consider doing it where the you know the senior executive leadership team and the google guys and your etno group if they're all going first maybe only give them like six months to a year of their data will let them know that the expectation is when you go live you'll either have all of you know you should have all of your data by go live that way you can get those phased people out of the way and if there are some long tail heavy migration users in those early phases they're not holding it up and you can still start you know reaching to the rest of your employees as soon as possible fantastic michael how about you so if there was one thing that i would advise is learn the skews so what we learned was um for people that work with microsoft they have an incredibly complex ecosystem and google is much more simplified than that but learning the skews of you know if you in in our case we have you know truck drivers and warehouse people they don't need an enterprise plus skew and then uh so make sure you get the right product in the right hands of the people that are assigned to it and going in know what those counts are going to be so that you size your environment correctly and then uh what we learned about after the fact was archive user for retention plans um you know there are a lot of solutions to back up and meet your legal requirements but uh archive user was something that we do we weren't aware of and after the fact it was like well this was a no-brainer why don't we just do this from that from the get-go yep that makes ton of sense melissa how about you um i think we would change a little bit our ambassadors program at first they were mostly our enthusiasts and people engaging other colleagues in google uh but i think if we had training them more deeply in our um tools they could help solve the problems from the inside and then we could have a much faster adoption uh because the process migration would be uh maybe smoother than it was uh so for gemini for example now we have a whole plan for for adoption too and we are doing that we are training our ambassadors to help them solve real problem in their teams and that's helping a lot so that's one thing i would have changed fantastic yeah it's interesting especially in the gen ai era the data migration story information governance having frontline worker skews what do they need have need to have access to but cleaning up before you move like being able to purge i've seen 80 of the data not move because it's either outside of compliance it's outside of retention policies it's cat pictures like take your pick you don't need to move everything like it's there's a big opportunity to start fresh and ai readiness that's a big big component of that right now um so last question ashley do you have a favorite product or capability i love the mobile applications like especially being here at the conference and still being connected to everything that's going on at work is just awesome like responding to emails my team sending me comms to review my team sending me you know requirements to review in a google doc and pulling it up and just like looking at it on my phone is just awesome so really i mean just being connected to any device anywhere is so great so i i love the mobile apps it just makes me work so much faster and be more productive fantastic michael i'm going to lean in on gemini so um with the advent of gemini what i've learned is it saves me a lot of time and it helps me take the emotion out of something like an email so if you do the help me write i may be reading an email and i'm like i need to get a reply out right now instead of starting to type something and maybe getting emotional i do the help me right okay let's just lay out the facts and then alter it to what my message needs to be and then that helps me get a lot of things out a lot faster and i think with a more concise message there you go that's great melissa i will go with take notes uh it changed the whole dynamic of our meetings we don't need people taking notes by hand anymore and everybody can be present in the meeting and then we just have uh the notes written down by gemini and we can follow up on them and that's great amazing yeah again staying present being able to be in the conversation yeah i think my mine's a tie it's deep research into the gemini app i love it and then i usually take the output of that and put it in a notebook lm which is my favorite product right now complete game changer for augmented intelligence and learning i know i wasn't supposed to ask myself that question but i wanted to uh so we've got a couple minutes left we do have some time for q a if anyone has any questions for our customers today around the transformation around the journey so if anyone has a question raise your hand we'll run a mic down to you it's very bright up here so i can't really see if you have any hands up are we all good well while we're waiting um speaking of notebook lm if you ever tried putting the deep reach yourself in there and then asking it to create a podcast for you and then listening to it rather than reading it that is awesome yeah the interactive feature is incredible like being able to interact with two ai hosts with almost zero latency on the content that you've grounded in again if you're not using notebook lm absolutely go dive into a gemini application with deep research it's just it's groundbreaking in terms of how you're able to up level your knowledge on information you're able to ground it in your sources information that exists within your corpus of workspace bring in things like youtube bring in pdfs it is it is an absolute game changer and talking about the transformation journey critical parts of the the kind of achieving that cultural change and forming people on the workspace journey it's you know it's a little meta but the tools are you know use those tools to drive adoption of said tools uh there's just so much opportunity out there i use a notebook lm on my phone all the time uh to prepare for things like this and and customer meetings and just try to be as informed as possible so still no questions oh we got one um hi everyone um how regarding the process migration uh what recommendations would you give us in order to separate and divide the different processes in order to start migrate migrating uh well the whole bunch of processes that you have in a company does anyone want to take that do you mean like separating gmail versus like you're one oh no i mean there's uh different processes in in each company and and and you need to migrate for the technological part to start using the different applications in workspace um how would you divide uh your teams and the processes in order to start the migration would you do it like part by part or would you do it a whole bunch in a in a single event i mean i don't know if i explained myself i can try that one in our case um we separated our processes by complexity so the most complex um processes we had our partner helping us with the transition so if we could um move the process from the spreadsheets we used to use before to uh sheets we did it with this partner helping us or the teams themselves could do it if it was a little bit more simple and second of all if we had uh processes that were mostly analytical uh we could do it by uh changing it to a data product so we had our data coaches helping us with this transition so we had experts in data building some analytics for us and the third one which was the hardest one um we had a bunch of um complex processes that were in spreadsheets like entangled spreadsheets um that were almost a little system by itself that we had to move to a digital product and in that way we had to involve our tech team so we mostly went from the most simple processes we had to the most complex one and just uh aligned them in a backlog and starting doing it with a partner and i would just add like your gmail like email migration like that you can kick off without like needing to separate anything there's a tool for that same with whatever you're previously on going to google drive like you can kick that off um then there's things around like business workflow transformation so that's what melissa's talking about like what what are people using in excel whether that's macros and stuff that you necessarily may need to like help show them into google cheats and that that's might be a little more complex and like need a little more hand holding and that that i would say separate from the migration process and then you have your chat messages that you may need to migrate over or any um like if you were using like a sharepoint site to google site that those kind of migrations and those i would recommend maybe like asking people if they even want it migrated um so that's what we did we sent out forms and we're like let us know if you need this thing migrated and we would do it um because all that stuff like especially old like chat spaces that they may have had they may be like retired or not need that information same with old sites that they may be using so i would take those as people want them move them and take that separately from you know the email and and you know file migration awesome and we really appreciate everyone's time today a big thank you to our customer panel i hope this is really informative thank you all i hope you guys have an incredible duel next uh please fill out the survey if you want if you want we want to make this better for next year so feedback is a gift
