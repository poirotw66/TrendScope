 . FEMALE SPEAKER 1 Please welcome Google Cloud AI Senior Director, Product Management, Warren Barkley. Hey. Welcome. Thanks so much for coming, spending a little time with us today. So we're really excited to have you here in Las Vegas with us. Now more than ever, the future is really about agent, employee, and agent, agent workflows. quickly emerging to be a mandate for every leader. Agents will play an important role working alongside your employees to drive efficiencies, decision making, and innovation. That's why at Google, we're really focused on empowering organizations to bring Gen.AI and real world agents quickly, efficiently, and responsibly. Customers are creating amazing stuff today. With Google Cloud, we're delivering the most comprehensive platform for building and adopting agents. In this spotlight, we're going to talk about these two pieces. So agent space and Vertex.AI. Let's start with Vertex. First of all, we start at Model Garden. Now, this is a really important thing. I'm not trying to have 20,000, 50,000, 100,000 models here. We're just trying to have the best models, the most efficient, and surround them with the tools. And that's why this is about having a platform, not just having a bunch of models that you could use. And of course, when you think about all those models, we're really excited about Gemini and what's happening with Gemini right now. The growth has been phenomenal. And so since we released Gemini about a year ago, we've seen 40x growth within Vertex.AI. And we have customers building just cool stuff. And just a couple weeks ago, we gave you a preview and announced we're going to have Gemini 2.5 Pro. You know, Gemini 2.5 Pro is all about advanced reasoning and thinking. And of course, we have Flash, 2.5 Flash, which is coming soon. You know, Flash is really the workhorse model. It's optimized for low latency, reduced costs, and it gives you impressive balance of these things when you're looking at high volume scenarios. Today, we're announcing the preview of LiveAPI for the Gemini models. OK, what is LiveAPI? Well, LiveAPI allows you to talk to the model. You can stream in streaming audio, video, text, and you can have low latency conversations with the model about stuff. When it comes to about models and choice, so if you kind of look at these like Imagine, Vio, Chirp, Lyra, with the addition of these models, Vertex.AI and Google is the only company that offers generative models across all modalities available today. So last year, we showed this video model that effectively allowed you to create videos. Now, we're transforming Vio with this new generation into a comprehensive video creation and editing platform. Within painting, you can remove things out of the background that you want to. And out painting, you can extend the frame of the existing video. We also have camera presets, which allows you to decide shot composition, camera angles, and create sophisticated cinoramic techniques. This word I always grew up, interpol interpretation. Yeah, I've tried it a bunch of times. I still don't get it. OK, what is it really? What is it? Is I take two images, the starting image and the ending image, and I just say, hey, Vio, use the starting and the image and bridge it and build a video in between it. And in Winline, we're also excited to announce, as you saw, Mark dropped Llama 4 on Saturday. It is now available on Vertex just a couple of days later. So let's move up the stack a little bit into Model Builder. We have kind of four verbs when you're looking at building and adapting models. You have discovery. We talked a little bit about that. You have tuning, customize, evaluation, and of course, monitoring and deploying. So let's kind of dig into that. Well, first, let's talk about discovery. How do we do that? Well, today we're announcing the Vertex AI Model Optimizer. What is that? Well, basically, what it allows is a fully managed service that allows you to get a high quality response to whatever prompt you send it to. And so think of it this way, as we actually take a look at the prompt and then route it to the right Gemini model for it to use. And so we're adding a whole bunch of tool sets here as well. So this Vertex Model Development Service, what is this really? What is this service? This service is made so that if you want to build your own foundation model, this service allows you to do that. And next is evaluation. It's a really tough area. We added a service last year. It was pretty comprehensive. And then we're adding actually more right now. And you can see these green boxes, all sorts of new. We're excited to announce Vertex Global Endpoint. You know, this is our worldwide load balancing system. We incorporate intelligent health checks, automatic failover, and we guarantee high availability using Google's robust international networks and infrastructure. So let's move up. Agent Builder. We have a ton of interesting things to talk about with an Agent Builder. But again, it really comes down to these four verbs. Develop, connect, deploy, and operate. And we're putting things in each of these boxes to make it really easy for you. Agent Development Kit is this new open source framework that simplifies the process of building sophisticated multi-agent systems. We also believe that MCP is going to be the new way and open standard that models are going to connect to data and tools, and we'll have MCP out of the box day one with the Agent Development Kit. Developers can use custom APIs with Apigee Hub or any of these pre-built connectors so you can connect to these open systems. Last year, we announced grounding with Google Search, grounding with your own data, and now we're announcing grounding with Google Maps. You know, one of the biggest challenges for enterprise AI and adoption is getting agents on different frameworks to work. And that's why today we're announcing a new agent to agent protocol, A to A, designed to let agents across different ecosystems communicate with each other. In fact, as of today, we have more than 50 partners signed up to help us evolve and have a shared vision on what this looks like. And that's why today we're also introducing Agent Engine. Agent Engine is a fully managed, enterprise-grade runtime, and it handles all the complexities of infrastructure scaling. From that, let's go to the top of the stack and talk about Agent Space. You know, Agent Space really helped you unlock all that data and allows you, your employees, to basically go across data silos and synthesize and understand it. With Agent Space, you get this multimodal search experience. So regardless where it is, where it's stored, what it is, text, whatever, you can find it. Next, we want to meet employees where they are. So this cool search, you can put it right in Chrome. Chrome Enterprise, in the search box, you can enable this right now. Next, we have Agent Gallery. This is really a cool thing. It's really a centralized hub for your enterprise-approved agents. So you can actually deploy them directly into Agent Space. And talking about agents, we're announcing two new expert agents today. Of course, it's not just about our agent experts. Your employees can make agents too. Agent Designer really democratizes the ability for you to build your own agents within Agent Space. But they actually respect and they're compliant with data security and access controls. Today, we have a bunch of partners who also built agents. And of course, finally, it's built on the same trusted infrastructure that billions of users use today at Google. Since the launch, we've seen tremendous interest in Agent Space. We have customers using this right today. Banco BV, Gordon Food Services, KPMG, Rubrik, Wells Fargo's. Clearly because it's demonstrating value that our partners like to see. We really understand the importance of enterprise readiness. And it's really at the core of our approach to Gen AI. Your data is your data. Customers own their data, not Google. And at every layer, we have built-in data governance. And we have enterprise data privacy and control. So you get to control your data. We provide indemnification. Not just indemnification on the generated output, but indemnification on the training data as well. We will stand there with you if something bad happens. And of course, today, we're also announcing sovereign AI services across the Google Cloud portfolio. And specifically for our government customers, we're excited to announce FedRAMP High for Vertex AI. The next thing that I've been very involved in is Google Distributed Cloud. And so we're announcing that Google Distributed Cloud will have Agent Space and Gemini to bring the latest models on premise and environment soon. And finally, we work closely with partners across the stack to help harness the power of Gen AI. We're training 400,000 experts on Google Cloud AI. With Vertex Agent Space, we're unlocking all this power of Gen AI and giving you this full platform that you can use to build agents and put them in your enterprises.msh, we're pumping partners with Team Rio station, studentathers, board loading stations, board come back.
