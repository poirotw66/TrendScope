 With natural disasters becoming more frequent than ever before, it's important now more than ever to address all stages of the disaster lifecycle. Here at Google, we believe geospatial technology can improve the process of not only anticipating hazards, but also responding to them. Today, we're excited to share with you some of the latest developments in our geospatial capabilities and how we're making them more accessible to the wider analytical community. Let's start by talking about some of the foundational Google technology that will help us get there. Through our suite of products, we've knit together a seamless experience to get you from raw data to data-driven decision making. Earth Engine is our cloud-based platform for geospatial analysis, allowing you to access petabytes of satellite imagery from the Earth Engine data catalog and aggregate and process massive amounts of raster or pixel-based data with applied remote sensing expertise. BigQuery is our fully managed warehouse for fast SQL analytics. When it comes to processing geography or vector data, we've made it easier than ever before by bringing geospatial analysis capabilities to BigQuery. BigQuery also works seamlessly with a number of our cloud tools, including Earth Engine and Vertex AI. The output of leveraging these tools together is insights that will inform your biggest sustainability questions. We wanted to bridge the geospatial capabilities of Earth Engine and BigQuery, bringing the best of both vector and raster analytics to one place. So at Cloud Next this week, we announced the launch of Earth Engine and BigQuery to Public Preview, an extension of BigQuery's current geospatial capabilities that will broaden access to raster analytics to the wider SQL community without needing remote sensing expertise. Specifically, we're launching two new features, a new geography function in BigQuery called STRegionStats, which allows you to derive statistics for an area of interest based on where the raster data intersects vector data in a BigQuery table. So for example, what is the mean water runoff for a county in North Carolina on a given day? Secondly, we're launching 20 new derived data sets in Analytics Hub for use in BigQuery, previously only ever available in Earth Engine. These are analysis-ready data sets that cover our most common sustainability use cases. You can always also bring in your own Earth Engine assets for custom use cases as well. On the topic of data sets offered to users of Earth Engine and BigQuery, we also recently launched Weather Next, a new family of global high-resolution AI models from Google Research and Google DeepMind. These new data sets are available in Earth Engine and BigQuery, enabling raster analytics for weather-related use cases. Now that you know more about Cloud's geospatial offerings, let's take a look at how to bring all these tools together at each stage of the disaster lifecycle. We'll use wildfires as an example. To assess wildfire risk, derived data sets use factors such as vegetation, soil conditions, terrain, climate, and burn history to model probability of fire. In this example, we use an analysis-ready data set in BigQuery called Wildfire Risk to Communities. First, you'll need to search for the data set in Analytics Hub. Then, you'll subscribe to the data set. This will add a table of image metadata to your project that can then be used to query imagery in Earth Engine with the new STRegionStats geography function. With the data subscription in place, you can then run a query in BigQuery to aggregate pixel values from the data set across each building footprint in the area of interest. The output of the query is a number of aggregate wildfire statistics for each building footprint in the area of interest combined with the other data spatially joined via existing BigQuery geospatial functions. These statistics can then be visualized on a map in GeoViz to show varying intervals of wildfire risk by color. To deliver actionable data to the public affected by an event, Earth Engine can be used to refine and mosaic raw satellite data, and Weather Next can be used to inform weather patterns relevant to a natural disaster. For example, during the recent wildfire events in Los Angeles, Earth Engine was used to process and mosaic daily overhead imagery of areas affected by the wildfire. That imagery was then made publicly available via Google Earth with daily image overlays and alert data. To rebuild after a wildfire, it is critical to understand what areas were affected. Google's Open Buildings Temporal Data Set from Google Research allows us to visualize and analyze building height over time, which can be useful to understand disaster impacts and inform where and how to rebuild when records of those structures are incomplete. In this example, we combine OpenStreetMap data for building footprints with OpenBuildings data to compute building height before and after the wildfire using the new STRegionStats function. As you can see, Earth Engine and BigQuery combined with advanced data sets such as Weather Next brings the best of geospatial analytics in one place, accessible by our widest community of analytical users.
