 I'm excited to talk to you today about how Google Cloud is transforming software development. We're locking your ability to build the next generation of agentic applications. Agent development kit, agent engine to help you run your agents, and agent space. All of this is powered by our Gemini models. From understanding videos to native image generation to grounding real information with Google search, these are the kinds of things that you can only build with Gemini. I'm here to show you all the goodness of the agent development kit, ADK, that we just released. Agent dev kit is public today. Agent engine makes it easy for you to deploy and run agents built on any agent framework. You know, to make it easier to connect any agents together, we actually just launched that agent to agent protocol. Just like MCP standardizes how agents connect to and use tools, A to A makes it easier to discover and connect agents, especially when those agents are from different ecosystems or vendors. Google is empowering developers to use the tools and models that you like best to build amazing apps. Even in tools like Visual Studio Code, Tab9, Cognition, and Ater. 2.5 Pro is now available in Gemini code assist for individuals. You can use it right now. Data Science Agent helps us turn that raw data into a data app. The Data Science Agent you just saw integrated in BigQuery notebooks is coming soon. We want to give you a sneak peek into what we really see as the future of software development. We've got some amazing features coming later this year that will make building software so much faster and easier. I am really excited to see what you all build next with Gemini and Google Cloud. Let's get out there and start building. Thank you.
