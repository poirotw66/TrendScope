 Hello everyone, my name is Vasu. At Google, I lead the architecture and industries function, which is part of Google Cloud Consulting Business. And I'm going to talk to you about the exciting outcomes from the session we had this morning on driving business value in the agentic AI era. We had a panel discussion. We had industry pioneers joining the panel. We had Tim Mason from Deutsche Bank who leads innovation. We also had Ignacio Garcia who is the CIO of Vodafone Italy and data and analytics director. And we finally also have Perry Nightingale from WPP who is the SVP from Creative AI. Now we all discussed about the key question that's going in the industry. Are you getting real value from your agentic AI investments? So the panel discussed on this topic but dwelled deeper into three key areas. Obviously, one of the areas is are you getting return on investment? The second one is what are the right foundations for you to be successful and to scale AI in enterprises? And the third question was how do organizations prepare for this change? What are the cultural shifts that are necessary? Through the panel discussion, we landed on the key messages. The panel believes that although we are in the early stages of agentic AI adoption, the floodgates could open at any time. For example, WPP has already got 28,000 agents deployed in production helping their enterprise. And we are also seeing evidence of agents being deployed in production and driving customer value in more nimble and cloud native organizations. However, the story is slightly different in regulated environments. We are seeing customers testing POCs and pilots, but they are still far off from deploying them in production. But this year we believe they are going to repurpose their energies in driving scale and productionizing some of these solutions. The panel also believes that models are an important part of agentic AI landscape, but we see models that are more vertically nuanced and are subject matter experts in specific domain playing a key role in agentic AI world. We need models that understand reasoning models who can work in creative context. We also see multiple models operating in harmony as a key pattern in agentic AI. But more importantly, the panel also believes there could be some ecosystems developing in the industry. We could see agentic AI marketplaces. We could also see professional networks for agents developing. This all indicates a rapidly maturing field. The panel also believes that organizations are in the early stages of thinking about how to figure out a hybrid workforce model with agents as well as human talent working together. What are the roles and responsibilities between them? How should a process operate with agents and humans together? And the panel posed an important question to the audience. What are the cultural shifts that are necessary in your organization to drive collaboration between agents and human talent? And how can you ensure that they don't compete with each other? So the panel came out with some good answers around foundations and models and all, but it left a lot of open questions for the audience to think through. And the biggest question that audience took away was what are the cultural shifts that are necessary in their organization to successfully adopt AI agents? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
