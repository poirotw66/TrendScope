 I'm Pablo Rojo. I'm software technical leader at Mercado Libre for NewSQL team. The mission of our team is to provide large-scale, impactful, distributed SQL database to thousands of developers. And to achieve this objective, we have Adopt Spanner. Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce, fintech, and logistic company in Latin America. We have operations across 18 countries, engaging over 100 million unique active users. Our team currently includes more than 90,000 employees. In the marketplace, we have more than 400 million eaten sold per quarter. With the marketplace and outside, we're processing more than 56 billion payments per quarter. Such a large-scale business needs equally a large-scale technology. To handle this massive amount of traffic, we rely on more than 35,000 microservices, running over 100,000 built-on machines across four cloud providers. To handle this large infrastructure is possible thanks to our engineering platform, Furi. Furi is a platform-as-a-service solution, built-in-mail, which runs on top of cloud providers. The motivation to create Furi was to attract more than 20,000 developers from the issue that they may have while running microservices, training machine learning models, or creating AI solutions. We have chosen Spanner because it's operational simplicity. Spanner is a self-managed database. Adopting it, we have removed a lot of manual tasks and reduced management overhead. Also, the scale capabilities are awesome. We can scale up and scale down the number of nodes transparently, automatically, without impacting our performance production and avoiding over-provisioning of resources. By other hand, simplest integration with BigQuery, coupled with features like chain streams and simple use of data flow, makes Spanner a great product to integrate with BigQuery and different technologies inside MercadoLibre. MercadoLibre is delivering a new way to shop. The chwilicorn coolest is an allies could Propagonal on Prevental louder than ihop. It's probably a number of nodes in delta reserved.
