 Welcome to AppSheet session recap. Before I walk through the demo that we sell live at Next, I want to take a step back and talk about what AppSheet is and how it can help solve some of your key business challenges. We know it's hard to provide digital solutions to streamline a whole bunch of workflows. Since they can go from general use cases to very nuanced and industry-specific. And we know it's also not realistic to provide custom, governed solutions for each one of those workflows. That's where AppSheet, Google's no-code platform comes in. It empowers your business users, those closest to the needs, to quickly build solutions like apps and automations directly on top of your business data. And all without writing a single line of code. AppSheet also provides admin built-in governance to help with security and compliance. At Cloud Next, we announced deeper integrations, more powerful automations, enhanced governance, and of course, the intelligence of Gemini with our new automation AI tasks. We also shared an example of an AppSheet app we built that handled an entire Helpdesk workflow, just one type of solutions that your citizen developers can build with AppSheet. This app handled everything from creating a support ticket through approvals, purchasing, and tracking orders. And all of the automated process began with a single user action, snapping a photo of the problem. By uploading the picture and using our new Gemini AI features, AI tasks in automation, which are to extract and categorize, we completely remove the need for manual input. Uploading that single picture triggered the entire workflow shown here. Using the Gemini extract and categorize tasks, AppSheet automatically identified product details, categorized the issue, routed it to the right team for resolution, and in this case, used our chat apps integration to gather approvals via single chat message. That approval then triggered a process to start the replacement order. And after the replacement was purchased, we used our new Gmail integration to process the vendor email, where Gemini extract pulled tracking information to update the ticket and send an SMS to the end user. And finally, thanks to our new integration with Google Sites, the whole help desk app, including the updated ticket, could be found and securely accessed on TeamSite. This is a powerful yet typical use case. Imagine the efficiency gained if that constant stream of user support requests for buggy software, inventory issues, or even broken hardware could be managed much more effectively. And everything we just walked through was built by a business user without writing a single line of code. As we just saw, a lot of these steps were powered by Gemini and AppSheet. So come try it out now and see how your automations get supercharged with these AI tasks. What we saw an example using an image, Extract now works with PDFs too. Now, before I wrap up, I want to take a step back and look at the three layers of AppSheet. We have the AppSheet solution, which is the app or automations, the editor, where your creators configure the apps and automations, and the data, which is the power of AppSheet because every AppSheet solution is data-centric. And while we've always connected to sources like Sheets in Excel, I'm excited to announce that the upcoming days, the Google Cloud Integration connectors in AppSheet will be GA. These connectors allow you to build apps and automations using your enterprise data systems like SAP, JIRA, and ServiceNow. And that means that all of AppSheet's Gemini-powered AI tasks, which you're able to use with no coding required, are also able to interact with those connected systems. Bringing AI into your workflows has never been this easy. And with this, I'm going to wrap it up and leave you with this slide so you can pause the video and see all the exciting launches we announced this year at Cloud Next. Now, it's time to go learn more about AppSheet. We can't wait to see what you build.
