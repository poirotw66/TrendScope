 Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Hope all of you enjoyed your lunch. I see some of you nodding off, maybe in the backseat. That's okay, I understand. But that's why we kept one of the most exciting sessions for this afternoon. We're going to find it very insightful, that I can assure you. But before we do that, how many of you have heard of Cognizant? My name is Arjun Air, and I head the lending portfolio for Cognizant. Let me give you a few examples of what we do. We helped a major U.S. bank save $9 million by scaling customer service with cloud and AI. We helped a major U.S. automotive retailer modernize their enterprise and achieve $50 million in savings. Any F1 fans? We are helping Aston Martin F1 act on intuition. Imagine the digital twin of an F1 call and using AI and machine learning to run simulations and make in-race predictions instantly, as if on intuition. At Cognizant, we engineer modern businesses using technologies like AI, IoT, cloud, and software engineering. As one of the world's leading professional services companies, we help clients across the globe reimagine processes, modernize tech, and transform experiences. And today, you're going to hear from one of our most strategic clients, Quartality, formerly Quartelogic, about their transformation across cloud, engineering, and business operations. Since 2011, Cognizant has been a strategic transformation partner to Quartality, providing capabilities in AI, software engineering, cloud, and domain-centric business processes. For me personally, it has been very fulfilling to be a part of this truly amazing journey. And without further ado, I invite all of you to listen to their story. Thank you. It's intelligence beyond bounds. We are Quartality. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining our session today. You might be a little bit confused about the video that was just shown about Quartality. You probably have Quartelogic on your agenda and wondering what's going on. It's because we have just launched our new brand, and Quartelogic is now Quartality. And if you don't know much about either of those names, Quartality is hands down the single source of truth for property data. We're a data-driven information services company that connects the entire property ecosystem. Connecting buyers and sellers, inspectors, claims adjusters, bankers, loan officers, the entire ecosystem. And our mission is to make the property industry faster, smarter, and more people-centric. And we deliver intelligence beyond bounds. I'm Jeff Henry, and I'm the CIO and the CISO for Quartality. And I brought here with me two of the smartest and most innovative executives of our company, our CTO, Matt Kernis, and our head of performance, excellence, Sedwin Vatica. And we're here to give you an inside view of our cloud transformation journey that was enabled by Google Cloud and supported by Cognizant. So just a little bit of audience participation. So raise your hands if you've been in meetings with your executive team, your product owners, trying to convince them to put on hold their new features and functions, their new capabilities for three months, maybe six months, to do a cloud migration. All right, a couple of you out there. Raise your hands if you've been in technical meetings with solution architects, principal engineers, maybe in an architecture review board, trying to convince them that Google Cloud is the right cloud. A couple here. And lastly, raise your hands if you have been on a bridge call on Saturday night at midnight, and all day on Sunday, hoping that your teams have done all the right work and all the right testing to have a successful cloud migration cut over on Monday morning. Got almost everyone in here, so that's great. Well, I've been in those executive meetings, and I've been in those technical meetings, and I've literally been on hundreds of those bridge calls over the past few years. And working with the teams in the trenches, migrating and transforming our digital ecosystem, it's been a monumental effort. And in fact, I think I used to have a little bit of hair back when we started. So it has been a long journey. But the good news is that now that we're here, we've achieved our goals, getting our digital ecosystem 100% in the cloud, and we're reaping the benefits of transformed cybersecurity, unleashed engineering, and AI-powered operations. So let's get started. When we started a few years back, we had a mess, right? We had dozens of data centers, all with different operating models for operations, for application deployments, for infrastructure management. We had very high duplicative costs. We had detractors, both on the business side and the technical side. As to whether we should even go to the cloud. It was just a mess. And so we kicked off with a simple commitment to our business, save money, improve our security posture, enable innovation, and simplify and scale our operations. And I've had many conversations in that time with my peers and the financial services industry. And I've heard of horror stories about, you know, huge, you know, large cloud programs failing, about messy and expensive cloud environments. And so we knew of some of these risks. And we thought it was imperative to have solid guiding principles, a single and sound operating model, and really good program execution. You can see the guiding principles here. They're probably familiar to you. They're cloud-native principles. But for me, I think the one that underpinned most of our success was automate everything. We literally automate everything. We don't even let our cloud engineers log into the console to touch anything with their fingers. Everything has to be done in an automated fashion. A couple of points on the operating model. Yeah, we had standards and blueprints, landing zones. But one of the keys was that it's centrally managed, but it's extensible and federatable. Some of our engineering teams are more mature than other teams. And they have the skills. They can manage their environment, their cloud environment. So we federate out the operations to them, and they can run things on their own. Another key part of our operating model is something that we call extreme visibility. That's visibility into costs, visibility into usage, into capacity, and our ability to deliver that in an easy way to all of the stakeholders, whether they're product management, whether they're the engineering platform owner, or accounting and finance. They need that information to help us run the environment. On the program execution side of things, we ran the program as an enterprise-wide, executive-level, top-down program. And we employed skilled cloud program managers, technical project managers, and solution architects from either sourcing internally or with Google or Cognizant to help lead the way for us. So now that we're here, the benefits are real. We have a 75% reduction in the number of incidents now that we're here. 75%. We've had a 50% reduction in the meantime to resolve for the incidents that we do have. We don't have any data centers, which is great. And best of all, we've saved $25 million of year-over-year operating costs. And so I would argue that those are reasons enough alone to go on this journey. However, we're here to talk a little bit more about some of the more exciting stuff. So, like security. Remember when it was really hard to rotate credentials, even on a yearly basis? Remember when it was hard to find that one subject matter expert, sysadmin, who was the only one that could patch certain servers and they had to do it one by one, by hand? With our cloud transformation and the foundation that automates everything, our assets are ephemeral. They're cattle, not pets. We can repave our entire 20,000 server footprint in less than two weeks if we have to. And we have a rotating every 45-day schedule of repaves across the environment. And remember when we used to spend a ton of time scanning for vulnerabilities after the fact, after they've already been released into production, and then even more time chasing down those vulnerabilities to try to remediate them in production? With our transformation, we've shifted left our security controls and scans in the application pipelines, and we're able to block deployments before those vulnerabilities even get into production. We've also shifted left our scanning for secrets that might be embedded in the code, and we can block code pushes before those secrets get released into the wild in our production environment. And I think the big one here is our environment, our network, is truly zero trust. No longer are the days for us when a bad actor breaches our front door, which they're always going to breach the front door, can they move laterally throughout our environment searching for even more treasure. And so there's probably some security professionals in the audience that have had some sleepless nights in the past six to 12 months worrying about some of the big challenges we have coming our way in the security space. Challenges like agentic AI. How do we authenticate and authorize or audit bots talking to other bots with no human intervention? What is their identity? Challenges like quantum resistance. Q day is coming. It might be three years. It might be five years. It depends on who you ask, but it's coming. And on that day, our encrypted keys are essentially clear text. So we've got to be prepared. We've got to start now with good crypto hygiene. And challenges like cyber resilience. How long is it going to take us to rebuild our entire control plane and all the applications on top of it from bare metal? And do we even know how to do that? What are the dependencies? It's a big challenge. And now that we've solved with our transformation, we've solved some of the more traditional security problems or mostly solved some of the more traditional security problems like vulnerability management and credential rotations. We can focus our very scarce cybersecurity resources time on these new big challenges. So now I would like to hand it over to Matt Kernis, our CTO, to talk a little bit about engineering. Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to start first with just to build upon what Jeff was talking about on the cloud transformation journey. From an engineering point of view, it's really been an enabler to help us focus more on the application code, think about what we're building from a capability perspective, and have that standard plane to really start to work from. But at Quotality, just like any company, Jeff had talked about all the data centers and all the different technology and ways that we worked. We had the same thing from an AM&A perspective on the way we built software. So with that, we had to start to take a step back and think through, you know, really what does engineering look like at Quotality? Because we wanted to work in one way, right? As we work through all the different capability sets, you saw all of the different property professionals that Jeff talked about earlier. We want to keep them front and center. We want to build capabilities that really empower that. So the conversations that happen in the virtual hallways at Quotality with our engineers, with our stakeholders, we really anchor on a few things. Are we building value, right, at the end of the day? Are we obsessed with the design and the quality and the experience of our applications? Again, thinking about the property professional or our operations staff, are they really finding what we're using or what we're building very useful? We want to make sure that we're predictable. We have commitments that we have to live up to to make sure that whether it's a business plan for our customers or internal use cases, we want to make sure that we're transparent and we're working through things in a very transparent way. But I would say the other part that's really important out of this list and some of the drivers that we'll actually dive into a little bit more are how do we start to build a common platform and how do we build an engineering culture that really unlocks our engineers to be thinking about creativity and bringing things to the market quickly that maybe we don't know when we first start a project. So these are just a few of the things that we talk about in the hallways and our journey down this path really starts next with how do we start to organize. As we were really built around a number of different companies just like with data centers and applications, we were very siloed. And one approach we took here is thinking about how does software flow through the organization and really the underpinning element to this is think about a capability, build it once, reuse it as many times as possible. And a good example of this is our data and analytics and insights that underpin all of the things at Coatality. So we've built a massive truth set around the property. We call it our Property 360. It has all the different data sets, 22,000 different data sets that have come into the organization. We build all the insights across our data scientists and our models. We have over 250 models that we've built with our team. We've built standard machine learning operations pipelines. We've started to build all the common capabilities like our authentication service, payment services, all the things that go into really enabling our products. And that's where our product streams really start to leverage, right? They use everything at the base as X as a service. So think of the APIs, think of all the foundational pieces. And we want our teams really focused on building those products and capabilities for the end market. To stitch those together, we have a few centers of excellence as we think about enabling teams around some of the generative AI pieces. How do we have trials and tribulations to help educate some of the teams in building some of these solutions? As well as some of the centers of excellence around architects, project managers, UX. It helps us stitch everything together. So that's a little bit of how we've organized. And it's really been a way to focus on both the use case and the foundation as we've been at this journey the last couple years. Now, underpinning all that, we've had to look at also our engineering element of how do we think about our practices? So we've standardized how we build software around our user-centered design approach. So we think about the user first. Our UX team is just a stellar team who's obsessed with usability to avoid rage-clicking when you're in that application through frustrations or making sure we're solving that value-add. But the UX team is really not out there alone. We have our engineers, we have our architects, our technical product managers with them so that they are hearing it firsthand from the users. And it's really helped us standardize to build products that are more useful at the end of the day. Also into the factory comes our global delivery piece. We leverage partners. We have our employees around the world. So time zones, thinking about the collaboration loops, have been a big component into how we segment some of those teams you saw earlier. And then I'll dive deeper into the developer experience and developer environments. But wrapping all this is our metrics, and we've tried to build transparency into how are our teams operating. And it's really helping us to swarm to maybe where we've got some stumbling blocks, maybe where team members are struggling through certain things. We want to make sure that, again, that transparency element is there. If we think about the developer experience, we've started out on a journey with a system called Driveway. And Driveway is our internal developer portal. And we were missing something that really brought the engineering community together because everything was locked in people's heads or it was in the Slack channel. It was through an email. It was very much a tribal environment to try to find things across the experience. As well as context switching. As we were thinking about working in Tool A and the IDE and working through all these different interfaces, the context switching for engineers became pretty heavy. So we thought about how do we simplify that. And that's where we focused on our internal developer platform called Driveway that really goes after a few pillars. First thing, what are those standards of the technologies that are out there? Instead of asking the architect through a Slack channel or an email, hey, is this approved? Go to a common place. We have a technology radar that is there. It is run by our A or B as well as the community going through this. One of our most visited pages in the platform. We also bring operations views. Looking at how our pods are running in the GKE engines or looking at various pipelines that are running. We want to bring that plane together so that, again, engineers can see how things are working on a daily basis. All of the platform services that Jeff had talked about around our CI, CD and interacting with those things. We brought those APIs together so that, again, those actions are in a common spot. And then ultimately, we're building towards some automation underneath of this. It's a little bit of a nod to the future with some of the agentic workflows where we can drive automation for engineers and a common place like provision that piece of infrastructure, provision that access to the API. All the great security controls and operating models that Jeff talked about, we want to surface that in a self-service way. And then most importantly, build in the compliance elements. So as we think about checklists, think about all the things that are you ready to go to production. Have you got all your vulnerability scans? Have you done all of the backup plans? All the things that go there, we start to gamify how we do our compliance. Again, keeping things front and center as we work through things. Going into the developer environments, we've approached it in a few different ways. Again, looking at all the different tools, there's been a lot of talk around the AI-assisted tool sets there. We've rolled that out in mass. We've seen a great improvement and attachment to those types of capabilities if we think about understanding code, knocking down the knowledge silos, as well as building new capabilities. Building golden paths are another way that we've started to build how do you get an engineer into the environment day one and be productive as quick as possible. So we've started to build a number of, again, enablers surface-through driveway as we think about swarming to new code, doing pull requests across teams along the way. And then on the horizon, we'll be looking at new frameworks, new tools. We're bringing in some of the agentic capabilities that you've seen released here this week. Again, starting to unlock some of the tool sets across the organization. Now, so what? We've been on this journey. At the end of the day, it's about value. Jeff had talked about some of the elements around the cloud journey. For us, we've been looking at how do we make sure that those metrics and measures are getting faster and more quality. We've seen a boost through some of the code generation tools and some of the frameworks that we've got in place. So we've been able to produce output with our teams 30% faster. And that's just been a joyful exercise with some of our engineers who have felt more engaged in adding more value. At the end of the day, we've also reduced the time it takes to build an AI model. Through standard ML pipelines, we've been able to shrink the time for some of the plumbing it takes to train a model, build that, and then serve for inference. We've also brought capabilities to our engineers to bring data into our Property360. And we saw a huge increase this last year of bringing more data sets together and offering more insights. And that has resulted in ultimately building new products, new insights along the way. And I'm going to show you one here in just a second with our property intelligence location platform, Araya, which is really built for all the property professionals out there to offer tools and insights to help them in their daily jobs. And the one that we're going to show today is focused on the mortgage persona as we think about finding new leads in the market, how are loans performing, and you'll see a little bit of what we've been able to build here over the last few years. So with that, let's roll the video. We'll see you next time. We'll see you next time. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. So with that, thank you. Thank you. Really proud of the team as we've built out these capabilities, leveraging all the greatest things that Google has to offer around some of the capabilities of BigQuery, Vertex, and the and the Kubernetes engine as well. So it's just been a tremendous experience with the team. More to come as we build out more capabilities for our property professionals. So next, I want to introduce my colleague Sedwin, who's going to take us through AI-powered operations. What a wonderful video to show the power of Araya. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take you guys through some numbers here. Cortality partners with over 22,000 tax agencies to pay over $200 billion in tax payments every year. We have a dedicated partner in working behind the scenes and creating innovative techniques and solutions to provide servicing and payment solutions to our customers who always dreamed of owning a home someday. And there are millions of such homeowners that we service every day. By leveraging our extensive network, scale, and connectivity, we support and service over 80% of US mortgages today. With our dedication, homeowners can move forward with confidence. They can feel safe and secure. Despite being the number one in the market, we are looking to not just outpace our competition, but build a future-proof, scalable business model that really reflects our operations teams to be feel belonged, and more importantly, our customers feel cared. As you all know, the mortgage market has been going through a significant beating post-COVID-19 due to inflation and Federal Reserve actions. There's still a lot of uncertainty if and when the market is going to bounce back. Regardless, our customers constantly push us beyond limits, ensuring that we are constantly looking for ways to improve quality, to improve cycle time, and finally to provide insights that they can supply to their homeowner community. When we reflect on our internal employee engagement survey results, clearly there's an opportunity to modernize our workflows so that all our users can provide and deliver high quality output every single day. Every loan that we service today goes through many different systems and applications that are not even owned or managed by quotality. Additionally, every taxing authority that we engage with, every client that we serve, requires something that's unique and custom to them because of the ecosystem they live in. Now this creates additional pressure on our users and ultimately results in unfortunate errors or defects. Now when I cumulatively look at all these challenges, they created a unique opportunity for quotality to find ways to improve both customer experience as well as employee experience like never before. With over 5,000 frontline staff within our operations group and over 300 people managers, it was really important for us to find a common language to drive change. The two core principles of lean, which is respect for people and continuous improvement, was nimble enough for our teams to go look for waste and find ways to eliminate seconds, minutes, and even hours of non-value added work that they can now reuse to support their clients in a more effective way. Lean also allowed us to propel beyond process improvements and look at ways in which we can apply technology in the form of digitization and automation. The combination of lean and technology helped create what we call as our operations transformation playbook. Number one, we believe that by bringing in an orchestration layer type of a solution that sits on top of all these different systems and applications allows to eliminate what we call as a swivel chair effect. When you do that, it allows us to consolidate different process workflows into a more modern user interface. This was possible when we leveraged the cognizant neuro business process workflow, which became the single pane of glass for all those 5,000 users that I just explained. As the orchestration layer concept kicked off, the teams realized that there's another opportunity, which is converting many years of business, client, agency rules into system code that can now propel the orchestration layer concept even further and drive automation. And for those really complex scenarios that automation was not able to take care of or perfect, we deployed AI to make the agents and users even more smarter and deploy machine learning models that not only provided confidence to the users whenever there was a judgment that needs to be made, but also learn from the actions that the user took. This was only possible by the close partnership we have with Google and bringing in the cloud capabilities into quotality. The structured approach that we applied using lean as well as innovating with technology has clearly paid dividend when you look at the number of ideas we have today within our ideation funnel. As with any change, we also followed a very structured approach in driving organizational change management, both for our people managers so that they know and can communicate the change well to their teams, but also for the users so that they feel really excited and delighted by all these new user workflows that we have provided to them. This transformation change was also important for our clients because they needed to believe that the user workflows were the right for them and more importantly, allow us to integrate into their ecosystem. This playbook, as you can see, generated over 14 high ROI projects that are driving step change improvements in quality, cycle time and efficiency anywhere between the range of 20 to 30%. We started our journey by the combination of Neuro and Google Cloud by taking a more vertical approach across tax operations. With the availability of APIs both for internal and external systems, we were now able to present the latest and greatest information to our users so that the data decisioning and the data validation steps can happen seamlessly. Besides employee productivity, we were also able to produce and create a management console for all our people managers that allowed us to track SLAs both at a process level as well as at an individual level so that they can drive the right interventions to improve operational performance. We have also now started to see a major shift in the thinking of our teams to move from more of a vertical approach to a horizontal approach. And this is where we see the extension of the technology capabilities that we have built in reusing them with minimum customization and also setting the bedstone for agentic AI to be explored even further. Now finally, the possibility of integrating all these new datasets that we have created directly into our Quartality products to unlock new and innovative use cases both for our customers as well as homeowners, such as leveraging our IVR workflows to do real-time data dipping into the datasets and providing information so that customers can self-service them when they call into our call center. As you can see, we are very aggressive but also deliberate about our transformation journey. The strong collaboration that we have across Cognizant and Google and many other teams really allowed us to propel innovation to the next heights. We also have real close collaboration across our product, commercial, operations, and technology teams to really execute on a robust plan that's lighting up every aspect of tax operations all the way from staff augmentation through to our call center operations. We believe we have the right to disrupt a market that has seen little to no innovation in many, many years. And that would not have been possible without the partnership that we have with Cognizant and Google. We envision a tax operations organization that breaks this multiple vertical silos to a single human-in-the-loop team that puts AI to work over the next three years. We also see the maximization of orchestration, automation, and augmentation. And of course, with the introduction of agentic AI that will allow quotality to stay at the top for years to come. Hope all of you have learned and also appreciate the journey that we are on at Quotality as we take intelligence beyond bounds. I would like to now welcome back Jeff and Matt to the stage as we wrap up the session. Thank you. Well, great. Thank you, Matt. And thank you, Sedwin. This is very interesting and great stuff. I just want to close out by leaving you all with a couple of takeaways. Number one, core logic is now Quotality. If I haven't said that enough, I just want to leave it again.
