 PETER FITZGIBBON, Hi. My name is Peter Fitzgibbon. I'm Senior Vice President of Professional Services at SATA, a Google Cloud Premier Level Partner. We had a great fireside chat with Secretary Amy Pacek of Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development and Joel Pinkle, head of state and local government sales at Google Cloud. Google's commitment to the public sector goes back to 2022. And actually, the relationship with Wisconsin goes back to the pandemic. We at SATA teamed up with Google to help Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development modernize a critical service for employers. So what do we talk about? What are we doing? Well, we discussed the modernization efforts. That includes features like a streamlined user interface, providing ease of use, time savings, secure and improved communications, and most importantly, a better experience for the employers of Wisconsin. We discussed SATA's application development capabilities, coupled with Google Cloud's technical expertise, which is a perfect match for working with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. Overall, I'm excited about the work SATA is doing with the department, with Google, and the endless possibilities we see for the future. If you'd like to know more, visit SATA.com. SATA.com.
