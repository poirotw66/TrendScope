 ANNIE MAWEAVER- I'm Annie Maweaver, a product manager with Google covering high performance computing for HPC. I'm excited to share with you how we at Google are supporting the future of HPC. This multi-year roadmap highlights Google Cloud's continuous and deep investment in HPC, demonstrating continuous innovation across infrastructure like our RDMA-enabled H4D, A4, and A4X VMs, software and tools like Cluster Toolkit, Parallel Store, Manage Luster, and key partner solutions. Scientific progress has advanced for decades through the interplay of three fundamental pillars, theory, experimentation, and computation. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a fourth pillar, and quantum computing will soon enable transformational capabilities in computation and AI. To help realize these opportunities for science, we are bringing together the best of Google DeepMind and Google Research with new infrastructure and AI capabilities in Google Cloud to accelerate discovery on the greatest scientific challenges. We're excited to introduce new supercomputing platforms that will unlock supercomputing class performance for current and future scientific applications and AI model training, including our H4D VMs, Google Cloud Managed Luster, the latest NVIDIA GPU VMs, and two AI-powered scientific applications. The first is AlphaFold 3, which can predict the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules with unprecedented accuracy. The second is WeatherNext, which will enable fast, accurate weather forecasting. We ran our own large-scale quantum simulation with up to 43 qubits in full state. This was a proof point of the possibility of creating these quantum circuits, and also a blueprint for you to use and customize to start building your own quantum circuits. H4D. These VMs are our best price and performance VMs for HBC workloads. Why? They boast the highest whole-node VM performance with 12,000 flops, exceptional per-node performance, and a remarkable 950 gigabit per second memory bandwidth. And what sets H4D apart is our 200 gigabit per second RDMA-backed network bandwidth over Google's Falcon technology. This is a first for our CPU offerings. This combination ensures low latency and efficient scaling, enabling customers to accelerate insights like never before. Sign up for the preview at this QR code. ParallelStore and ManagedLuster are our two parallel file system offerings, and they're both in preview today. Now, the difference between the two parallel file systems is that ParallelStore is a scratch offering, while ManagedLuster is scratch and persistent. ParallelStore scales up to 200 terabits, while ManagedLuster scales up to one pedigree. Both have integration with GKE, and both have the ability to move data to and from Google Cloud Storage. And they deliver high performance for your large VM clusters. At the link in the upper right, you can find reference architecture for our ParallelStore solution. We'll be releasing a ManagedLuster architecture in the near future as well. The Cluster Toolkit is a modular, composable toolkit written in Terraform designed to make it quick and easy to deploy repeatable turnkey HPC environments with Google Cloud's best HPC practices built in. The toolkit consists of three key components. First, a blueprint, which is exactly what it sounds like. It is a design for what your HPC environment should look like with components that you can easily swap. Next, the blueprint references modules that the toolkit supports. And these modules break down into categories like schedulers, storage, and general purpose. Modules then deploy onto HPC infrastructure to run your HPC workloads. The toolkit greatly simplifies creating these HPC environments, writing a lot of the infrastructure code for you. Join the Google Cloud Advanced Computing Community, an open forum for professionals, customers, partners, and really anyone interested in learning more about HPC, AI, quantum, and large-scale analytics. This community is a place to connect, share knowledge, build expertise, and accelerate innovation together. Engage with us through our online, biweekly sessions and our in-person meetups at major events. Use the QR codes to join the community and to catch up on previous sessions on our YouTube page. Thank you so much for your time and attention. Let's go build the future of HPC together. these programs that are being discussed with Michael Sink &��� heintyC World
